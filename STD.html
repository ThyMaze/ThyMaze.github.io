  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>You never thought that a room like this could exist in such a gloomy place, Colorful torches light the area, The room is not big at all, Yet it makes you feel cozy, In this room you found a table, On that table was a scroll tightly shut, With a little bit of force you manage to read what's written, Well you tried at least, The narrator uses english and the player too, but you don't buddy, anyways here is what it said</b></p>
  <p class ="text1" align="center"><b>Hey hoe :) Well you Must find this room because this is what i wanted to tell you, I wanted to say this just normally but i thought making this is a much better idea, So in case you noticed it or nah, I actually like you , A LOT, I like you so much that i start to giggle like a little girl when my phone viberates, I love everything about you, Your face is just too cute, Out of a drawing, Your personality cannot be better, Dank enough and understands the random shit i do, Voice so heavenly i can't have enough of it, As soft as a harpe playing, I just started feeling that way lately and i didn't want to keep inside me so i made this all as an excuse to tell you this :) hope you like it and actually share the same feelings ._. love youuuu (Truely though) </b></p>
  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>PS : Since i'm bad at coding to replay the game and found the intended way out close the window and reopen it ._. </b></p>
