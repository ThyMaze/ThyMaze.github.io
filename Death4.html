  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>You started looking like a maniac, Every corner was inspected by your hungry eyes, Until you came up with what you wanted to find, The truth, You found a small, Well hidden lever, You were so happy to make a find you switched it without a second thought, As soon as you did it you knew you've done something bad, A giant stone walls goes up from the ground and locks you into the rooms, And to makes matters worse, Those dangerous insects you were afraid of are now in the same room as you, one as long as your fingers, a huge bunch of them attack you at once, You had a slow death filled with agony, But hey, At least you guesses something, Right?</b></p>
  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>PS : Since i'm bad at coding to replay the game and found the intended way out close the window and reopen it ._. </b></p>
