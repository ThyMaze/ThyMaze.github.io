  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>After all you were dumb enough to trust a dark spirit, And it exploited this flaw and managed to kick you out of your body so it tastes flesh once more, Although it knew the way, It wasn't planning on showing it to you, And you were dumb enough to fall for it, Now Trapped in an eternal tourment, You don't know if you want to trick anyone passing by just like you got, Or keep flying like an aimless ghost till the univers ends</b></p>
  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>PS : Since i'm bad at coding to replay the game and found the intended way out close the window and reopen it ._. </b></p>
