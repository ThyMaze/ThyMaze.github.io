  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>You didn't want to do anything before you know what those ticking noises were, You checked the ceiling, Little by little until you found some sort of a handle, You wanted to pull it but you were extremly afraid something bad happens, But you somehow managed to convince yourself that it's the right thing to do, So after you made peace with the gods you believe in you pulled that, Then a broad smile shined on your face, Well not literally but sun shined on your face, Those ticking noises were people looking of the trapdoor you got out from, They wanted to see where the echo is, Shocked by seeing you getting out, They took great care of you at their camps and they tried to extract as much information as they could, You were glad to answer with what you knew, So then they sent you home and you lived happy until the days where you felt really proud telling this story to your grand children.
