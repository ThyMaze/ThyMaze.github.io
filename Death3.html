  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>You looked in every little corner, You pressed walls until You found something, A button, You pressed it while having miwed emotions, A mix of fear and joy, You looked at the ceiling and admire it as it opened, You thought that it was it, Freedom is yours, But you soon got sunk into disbelief as no sun rays faced you, All what faced you is a giant boulder, You couldn't feel guilt of what you did beacuse you were dead, Of course</b></p>
  <p class ="text" align="center"><b>PS : Since i'm bad at coding to replay the game and found the intended way out close the window and reopen it ._. </b></p>
